# Data Handling Design

This document describes how FlyBrief loads and exports data using JSON structures:
- **Data Loading**: Loads project data from a JSON file, including visual concepts, prompts, and images.
- **Data Export**: Exports selected images and their order in a JSON format for use by video editors or for storage.
