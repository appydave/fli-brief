## 1. Color Palette

The FlyBrief branding uses a set of greens complemented by black and white for a clean and modern look. Below are the primary colors, their hex codes, and their usage.

### **Primary Colors**

- **Green 1** (Main Accent Color)
  - **Hex**: `#09afb1`
  - **Usage**: Primary buttons, important accents, and action items. Use this color for elements that need to grab attention without overwhelming the interface.
  
- **Green 2** (Secondary Accent Color)
  - **Hex**: `#72bcb0`
  - **Usage**: Secondary buttons, hover effects, and UI elements that need to complement the primary accent color.

- **Green 3** (Background Accent)
  - **Hex**: `#bef6f3`
  - **Usage**: Light background color for sections, containers, or cards that need subtle separation from the main background.

- **Green 4** (Light Highlight)
  - **Hex**: `#9cf4e7`
  - **Usage**: Very light highlight for hover states, subtle highlights, or dividers.

### **Neutral Colors**

- **Black**
  - **Hex**: `#000000`
  - **Usage**: Primary text color for headings and important content.

- **White**
  - **Hex**: `#ffffff`
  - **Usage**: Main background color for large sections and text on dark backgrounds.

- **Headings**: Use a bold, sans-serif font (e.g., **Roboto**, **Helvetica Neue**, or **Arial**).

Font colors:
- **Primary Text**: Black `#000000` on light backgrounds.
- **Inverse Text**: White `#ffffff` on dark backgrounds.

## 4. UI Element Styles

- **Icons and Borders**:
  - Use **Green 1** or **Green 2** for icons and borders to match the primary and secondary accents.
  - Hover or focus states should use **Green 2** or **Green 4** for subtle changes.

  - Use **White** for the main background.
  - Use **Green 3** for light sections or areas that need separation without strong contrast.

## 5. Best Practices

- Maintain consistency: Ensure all elements, from buttons to text, follow the color and typography guidelines.
- Avoid overusing accent colors: Use **Green 1** for primary actions and **Green 2** sparingly for complementary purposes.
- Use **White** and **Black** as neutral colors to maintain contrast and readability.
