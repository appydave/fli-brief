# Interaction Design

Details on key interactions within the FlyBrief interface:
- **Drag-and-drop image reordering**: Users can drag images in the right-hand panel to reorder them, and the central grid reflects the updated order number.
- **Panel locking**: Users can lock/unlock panels using the "Lock" button or the Command + ~ hotkey. The panel remains open when locked and closes when unlocked and hovered away from.
