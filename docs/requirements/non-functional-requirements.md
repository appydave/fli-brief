# Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
FlyBrief must handle large datasets efficiently, including video projects with many visual concepts and large image assets.

### Responsiveness
The UI should be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. The dockable panels should function smoothly on both desktop and tablet devices.

### Modularity and Reusability
The dockable UI framework should be **loosely coupled** to ensure it can be reused in other FlyVideo tools. Each panel should function independently to allow easy removal or repurposing.

### Security
Project data should be saved locally unless specifically exported. No external data transmission should occur without user consent.
