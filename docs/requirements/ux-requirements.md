# UX Requirements

### Dockable UI Framework
The dockable UI serves as the foundation of FlyBrief and is designed to be modular and reusable across other FlyVideo tools. The framework supports the following panels:
- **Header** (top)
- **Left-hand panel** (navigation)
- **Right-hand panel** (attributes/details)
- **Footer** (bottom)
- **Central Grid** (main workspace)

### Docking Behavior:
- Each panel (header, left, right, footer) should be **collapsible** and **dockable**.
- Users should be able to lock/unlock panels using a **lock button** or the **Command + ~** hotkey.
- Panels should support **mouse hover** for quick access and can lock into place when needed.

This dockable framework will be loosely coupled, ensuring it can be reused in other FlyVideo tools.
