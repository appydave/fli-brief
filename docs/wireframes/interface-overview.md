# FlyBrief Interface Overview

## Overall Structure:
The application is built around a **dockable interface** with collapsible panels that surround a central grid. There are four main sections (header, left-hand panel, right-hand panel, and footer) plus the grid in the middle. Each section has specific functionality, but all panels can be collapsed/expanded, and there are icons or buttons to lock them in place.

## Main Layout

### 1. Header (Top)
- **Project Name and Dropdown**: Display the current video project name, with a dropdown to switch between other video projects.
- **Internal Search Bar**: Allows users to search within the project for visual concepts, transcript sentences, or assets.
- **External Project Switch Button**: A button or icon next to the search bar to switch to a different project (external search).
- **Settings Button**: A small icon for accessing global settings.

### 2. Left-Hand Panel (Navigation)
- **Hierarchical Transcript Navigation**: This panel is divided into three collapsible sections: **Intro**, **Content**, and **Outro**. Each section contains the relevant transcript sentences, and under each sentence are related **visual concepts**.
  - Each visual concept is represented by a clickable row.
- **Tags/Labels**: Special items, such as **Calls to Action (CTAs)**, should be tagged or marked visibly.
- **Settings Button at the Bottom**: Additional settings or debug options accessible from the bottom of the panel.

### 3. Central Grid (Main Workspace)
- **Rows for Visual Concepts**: The grid consists of multiple rows, where each row represents a **visual concept**.
  - Each visual concept row contains thumbnails for **images** generated by prompts.
  - **Prompts** (both original and enhanced) are displayed above or next to the images in a collapsible section.
- **Image Selection**: Each image thumbnail can be clicked to assign a selection number (1, 2, 3, etc.), representing the order in which they will be used.
- **Hover Effects**: When hovering over a row or image, details about the visual concept should appear in the right-hand panel.

### 4. Right-Hand Panel (Attributes)
- **Visual Concept Details**: This panel shows detailed information about the currently selected visual concept, including:
  - **Transcript Sentence**: The sentence that this visual concept is linked to.
  - **Prompt Information**: The original prompt and the enhanced prompt.
  - **Larger Image Preview**: When hovering over or selecting an image in the grid, a larger version of the image appears here.
- **Drag-and-Drop Image Reordering**: The panel displays a list of selected images, and users can drag and drop to reorder them.

### 5. Footer (Optional, Bottom)
- **Project Progress Bar**: A visual indicator showing the percentage or number of images selected compared to the total needed.
- **Save/Export Buttons**: Simple buttons for saving the project or exporting the current data (e.g., selected images and metadata).
- **Undo/Redo Buttons**: Small circular icons to undo or redo recent actions.

## Key Interactions to Highlight
- **Collapsibility**: Each panel (header, left, right, and footer) can be collapsed or expanded by hovering near the edges or clicking a lock icon.
- **Lock Icon**: A small lock button on each panel allows the user to keep the panel in place, otherwise, it hides when the mouse moves away.
- **Command + ~ Shortcut**: A small note near the lock icon should indicate that pressing Command + ~ can lock/unlock panels.

## Visual Flow of Interaction
- **User clicks on a visual concept in the left-hand panel**: The related visual concept row in the central grid is highlighted.
- **Hovering over a visual concept in the central grid**: The right-hand panel updates with the selected conceptâ€™s transcript sentence and prompt details.
- **User selects images from a visual concept**: The user clicks on image thumbnails, and the selection order is updated in the grid and displayed in the right-hand panel.
- **Reordering images in the right-hand panel**: Users drag and drop selected images in the right-hand panel, and the grid reflects the changes.

## Final Notes for the Sketch
- The general layout should focus on a clean interface with clear sections and collapsible panels.
- Each section should be visually distinct but consistent in style (e.g., using similar icons for collapsing/locking panels).
- The central grid should be the dominant area, with the left-hand navigation panel and right-hand attributes panel acting as supportive elements.
